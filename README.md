# NEDS_AMA
From the HCUP - National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) we have scraped the data for patients who were discharged from the ED against medical advice (AMA) and looked at the trends of this patient population from 2006 - 2014
The data was collected through my colleague Joshua D. Niforatos, MTS. And this project was conducted as a part of a research letter we are going to submit to JAMA in coordination with Dr Ali Raja,MD, MBA, MPH.
I hope this would help you in understanding the database. Any comments or questions are welcome.
